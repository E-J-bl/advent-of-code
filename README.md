# advent-of-code
behold the glory of a incoherent mess created in the five minutes after you wake up. 
Most of this code is writen to work, not to make sense  or be good practice.
Most variable are initialised when i need them not where they should be.
No functions are willingly used and i will not explain anything except under threat of torture.
